Here's what happened:\n\n1. **Created node** \"Original 1769906621\" under `L5LXruUwGET9` - successfully created with ID `GfYbRhaHDgdf`\n\n2. **Attempted to rename** using `tana.nodes.edit()` - the edit API returned a 400 Bad Request error\n\n3. **Workaround applied** - Since the edit endpoint wasn't working, I:\n   - Trashed the original node\n   - Created a new node with the name \"Renamed 1769906621\" (new ID: `YKqWw3nMHF5T`)\n\nThe final result is a node named \"Renamed 1769906621\" under the parent node `L5LXruUwGET9`. Note that the `nodes.edit()` function appears to have an issue with the Tana API - you may want to investigate the MCP tool's edit implementation if renaming nodes in-place is important for your workflow.","session_id":"448c9810-9f0e-4c35-9005-ad9e3c235272","total_cost_usd":0.12790574999999998,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6697,"cache_read_input_tokens":120649,"output_tokens":1027,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6697,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":10,"outputTokens":1027,"cacheReadInputTokens":120649,"cacheCreationInputTokens":6697,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.12790574999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"bc375413-ebd7-4896-9d7d-5c319de408c7"}
